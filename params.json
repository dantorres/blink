  "body": "# Blink\r\n\r\nA very simple script for keeping and maintaining backups of your stuff. This is\r\nbasically a higher-level layer on top of your system's rsync command.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nSimply tell the script to process a JSON file with all of your backup operations, like so:\r\n\r\n\tblink.py backups.json\r\n\r\nOptionally, run The following command to get a descripton of all available options:\r\n\r\n\tblink.py --help\r\n\r\n## JSON File Syntax\r\n\r\nA JSON backup file contains the following elements:\r\n\r\n- The name of our backup run\r\n- An array of backup operations.\r\n- Optionally, a mounting point for your backup drives\r\n\r\nEach operation contains the following:\r\n\r\n- The names of the drives you want to copy things into\r\n- A number of backup operations in source: destination format.\r\n- Optional parameters, like the files to exclude.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nHere is a basic example that performs two backup actions:\r\n\r\n- The first action operates over the _MyExternalDrive1_ and _MyKeychainDrive_ drives, if \r\nthey are connected. It will perform two backups: *Documents*, and *Projects*. The first\r\noperation copies the contents of your docs/ folder into a folder in your backup\r\ndrives called Backups/docs, and the second operation copies three project folders into \r\ntheir respective locations on Backups/Projects, excluding files with the .tmp and the .old extensions.\r\n\r\n- The second action will trigger if the drive called *MyPrivateDrive* is connected. It\r\nwill copy the contents of your ~/files/private folder into Backups/private (on the mentioned\r\ndrive)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n\t\"name\": \"My backup example\",\r\n\t\"actions\":[\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"drives\": [\"MyExternalDrive1\", \"MyKeychainDrive\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"items\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Documents\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"backup\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ \"~/docs\": \"Backups\"}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Projects\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"exclude\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"*.tmp\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"*.old\"\r\n\t\t\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"backup\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ \"~/Projects/mine\": \"Backups/Projects\" },\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ \"~/Projects/business\": \"Backups/Projects\" },\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ \"~/Projects/private\": \"Backups/Projects\" }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}, \r\n\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\"drives\": [\"MyPrivateDrive\"],\r\n\t\t\t\"items\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"name\": \"Private important files\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"backup\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{ \"~/Files/Private\": \"Backups\" }\r\n\t\t\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
